Final project for CS 439 Intro to Data Science. In order to run the project properly, please make sure you have the following python libraries installed: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, Beautiful Soup, sklearn, and XG Boost. Also, as I mention in my Jupyter Notebook file, I provide the code for web scraping the datasets that I scraped, but I do not reccomend running those scripts in my project, as pro-football-reference.com often blocks requests that come in too quickly if it thinks you are trying to scrape data. Instead, the scraped data is already provided in CSV files that are included in this repository. You can simply skip the web-scraping and run the project, loading in the CSV files under the web-scraping code.
